# Lowest-Common-Ancestor
In graph theory and computer science, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes *v* and *w* in a 
tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) *T* is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both *v* and *w* as 
descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself (so if *v* has a direct connection 
from *w*, *w* is the lowest common ancestor).
